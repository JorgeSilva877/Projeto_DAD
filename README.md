For this project, we were asked to develop a Single-Page Application (SPA) for a Memory Game Platform. The goal is to allow users to play a digital version of the classic Memory Game with differente board sizes.

To achieve this, we are implementing:

A frontend using Vue.js, ensuring a responsive and interactive user interface.
A backend with a RESTful API using Laravel and a WebSocket server, responsible for game logic, user management, and a chat for the players to interact.
A database to store user accounts, game history, and transactions, supporting a virtual credit system called "Brain Coins."
Registered users can track their performance through leaderboards, and purchase additional Brain Coins for extended gameplay. The platform also includes administrative controls for managing users, transactions, and platform statistics.

I just noticed (20/03/2025) that we only uploaded the front end here and not the backend and websockets part but i will upload it once i get those files back (I recently factory reseted my pc and im waiting for one of my colleagues to send me the rest of the project so i can upload it here).
